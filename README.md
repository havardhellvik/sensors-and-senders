# sensors-and-senders

This repository contains source code for FMUs for generating NMEA sensor data for GPS, wind, gyro and vru sensors as well as an FMU for sending NMEA telegrams. These FMUs are used in the [virtual commissioning](https://opensimulationplatform.com/use-cases/#commissioning) use case, where they are used as network FMUs for communicating with the control systems, and in the [sensors-and-senders](https://github.com/open-simulation-platform/demo-cases/tree/master/sensors-and-senders) demo case.
